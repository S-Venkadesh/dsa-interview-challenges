### [Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome)

- The program counts the frequency of each character in the input string s and calculates the length of the longest palindrome that can be formed using those characters.
- It adds 2 to the length for every pair of characters and includes a central character if the original string length is greater than the count of pairs.

```js copy
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestPalindrome = function(s) {
  let longestCount = 0;
  let charCountObj = {};

    for (const char of s) {
        charCountObj[char] = (charCountObj[char] || 0) + 1;
        if (charCountObj[char] % 2 == 0) longestCount += 2;
    }
    return s.length > longestCount ? longestCount + 1 : longestCount;
};
```
